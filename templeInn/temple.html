                <b>History:</b><br><br> The Newport Beach Planning Commission gave its approval for the Newport
				Beach California Temple on October 3, 2002, despite protests from the numerous 
				residents in attendance. The Church worked closely with residents in a spirit of 
				compromise, making changes in response to their concerns that included turning off 
				flood lighting by 11:00 p.m., changing the color of the building from off-white to an 
				earth-tone shade of seashell, and reducing the height of the spire from 124 feet to 100 feet.
                <br><br>On January 13, 2005, a statue of the angel Moroni crowned the temple. During placement,
				a remarkable solar halo was visible, which surrounded the sun. Once Moroni was in place,
				the phenomenon dissipated.

            <li>
              <b>History:</b><br><br> Elder Stephen A. West, who presided at the groundbreaking ceremony, stated at that
			  occasion, "Our homes are where we become prepared to go to the temple. Carved over the temple door 
			  is the phrase, 'The House of the Lord.' Our houses should be homes where the Lord could be comfortable 
			  to visit. In the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple it was said?'establish a house, even a house
			  of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of 
			  order, a house of God.' May that be said of our homes as well."

			<br><br>The temple's construction is of exceptional significance for the many second and third generation 
			Latter-day Saints who moved from Utah to Richland during the build-up of the Hanford site in World War 
			II. These faithful saints who have remained in Washington for many years will now be blessed with the 
			proximity of temple as enjoyed by most Utahns.

			<br><br>Elder Lowell Barber, Area Authority Seventy, quoted the First Presidency from a letter written in 1893,
			counseling Church members how to prepare for temple worship: "Before entering into the temple to present 
			ourselves before the Lord in solemn assembly, we shall divest ourselves of every harsh and unkind feeling
			against each other,?that we shall confess our sins one to another, and ask for forgiveness one of another;
			that we shall plead with the Lord for the spirit of repentance, and having obtained it, follow its 
			promptings?"

            <li>
              <b>History:</b><br><br>On the evening of January 27, 2008, one week before the scheduled dedication 
			  of the temple, news traveled across the globe of the passing of President Gordon B. Hinckley, who had 
			  intended to dedicate the temple. To accommodate Pres. Hinckley's funeral, the dedication ceremony was 
			  postponed one week. On the day of the originally scheduled dedication, President Thomas S. Monson was 
			  ordained the 16th president of the Church and assumed the task of dedicating the temple the next week 
			  as his "first official act" as president. Dense fog the morning of the dedication prevented his plane 
			  from landing in Idaho Falls as scheduled, so the plane was rerouted to Pocatello, and the final 
			  80 miles of the trip was resumed by car. President Henry B. Eyring of the First Presidency and Elder 
			  David Bednar of the Twelve, both former presidents of Ricks College, planned to attend the dedication,
			  but Pres. Eyring was prevented due to a broken ankle. The four dedicatory sessions were broadcast 
			  throughout the region to the thousands of members wishing to attend.8 In his dedicatory prayer, Pres. 
			  Monson declared, "May Thy faithful saints of this and future generations look to this temple as a 
			  sanctuary and a place of service to Thee and to Thy children."

              <b>History:</b> <br><br>150th operating temple. After standing unharmed for 125 years, the Provo Tabernacle met
              tragedy on December 17, 2010, when a four-alarm fire, reported at 2:43 a.m., engulfed the building—ripping
              through wooden pews, organ pipes, a rented Fazioli piano, priceless pioneer craftsmanship, and original
              pieces of art. For hours, a crew of approximately 25 firefighters subdued flames and doused the building
              with water. Around 5:00 a.m., the roof began to collapse, giving way completely within the hour and
              dragging
              with it portions of the front parapet and wall. Crews were still drenching hot spots by mid-afternoon, but
              felt encouraged by the still-standing exterior walls. Tearful crowds gathered throughout the day, looking
              on
              in reverent dismay as black smoke billowed from the iconic edifice. Perhaps the most remarkable discovery
              made among the ashes the day after the fire was a giclee print of The Second Coming by Harry Anderson,
              which
              depicts Jesus Christ coming through the clouds with heralding angels on either side—a picture frequently
              featured in LDS temples. The tabernacle painting, which sat inside the east front door, was completely
              blackened by residual fire except for the untouched figure of Jesus Christ himself with hands
              outstretched.
              Those who saw the painting in person were awestruck. Officials directed the print to be removed
              immediately
              for conservation and stabilization. It was handled with the greatest care, wrapped in plastic, and loaded
              into a waiting truck. The extraordinary occurrence was dubbed by some to be a "Christmas miracle."
